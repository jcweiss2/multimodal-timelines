This folder (note_browser_pakdd2024) contains code for the R Shiny visualization tool to
load multi-modal data (structured and unstructred data) and to annotate the case reports.

To run, set the paths in 'main.R' and run.

To run with i2b2 discharge summaries, first format the structured and unstructured data according to the 
formats in the demo examples 'dat' and 'matched.csv' and point the paths to those files.  There is commented
code to assist in this process.
